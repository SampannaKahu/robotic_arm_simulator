# 2-DOF Robotic Arm Simulator {using Processing3}

This repository contains the code for the software simulation of a 2-DOF robotic arm. This arm moves in a single plane and is controlled by two motors - one motor at each joint. The simulation will be controlled using the conputer's mouse and its results will be given as input to the robotic arm in real time. The input to the arm will consist of two values - the angles of the two motors. The arm will be controlled by an Arduino Uno R3, which will get the inputs from the computer via an USB cable connected to the computer.

## Setup guide
This repository currently has only one file - the '.pde' file.
1) To run this simulation, you need to download Processing. Preferably version 3 or higher. Download it [here](https://processing.org/).
2) Once the setup is done, download and open the 'RoboticArmSimulation.pde' file in Processing. Processing will ask you to move it in a folder with the same name if you have downloaded just the file.
3) Run the program using the 'Run' button.
